# VPUFS
This repository contains the implementation of VPUFS, a novel unsupervised feature selection framework designed to effectively reduce the high dimensionality of microarray gene expression data for cancer sample clustering.

📌 Overview


Gene expression datasets are highly dimensional, with only a small fraction of features (genes) being truly informative for classifying or clustering cancer samples. VPUFS addresses this issue by selecting the most relevant and non-redundant features using:

-Variance Score: Measures relevance based on statistical variability.

-Pearson Similarity: Identifies and eliminates redundant features by measuring pairwise correlations.

-The selected features can then be used to improve performance in clustering algorithms such as K-Means, Spectral Clustering, GMM, etc., providing better insights into cancer subtypes.


## ⚙️ Features


-Unsupervised feature selection (no class labels needed)

-Efficient reduction of high-dimensional microarray gene data

-Improved clustering results using selected features

-Evaluated on multiple datasets: Leukemia, Colon, Prostate, Breast

-Tested against established techniques (Laplacian Score, MCFS, JELSR, NDFS, LDFS)

🧮 Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
Remove null/duplicate rows and columns

Separate target labels (if available)

2. Feature Scoring
Variance Score: High variance = high relevance

Pearson Similarity: Measures redundancy between features

Non-Redundant Score: 1 - max(Pearson Correlation)

Final Score: Variance × Non-Redundant Score

3. Feature Selection
Sort features by score

Select top-𝑞 ranked features

Output: reduced gene expression matrix

📊 Performance Evaluation
Classifier: SVM with LOOCV, 5-fold, and 10-fold cross-validation

Clustering: K-Means, GMM, Agglomerative, SOM, Spectral

Metrics: Rand Index (RI), Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)

VPUFS outperforms most traditional unsupervised methods in terms of both classification accuracy and clustering performance.
